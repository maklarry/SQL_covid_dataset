# SQL_covid_dataset

COVID Dataset of the African continent using SQL from the first recorded incidence up to September 2022.
I analyzed the COVID Dataset for the African continent. I obtained the data from Kaggle. I used SQL to make my analysis. I was able to answer important questions such as:
Which top countries had the highest recorded cases, deaths, and recoveries?
Which top countries had the lowest record cases, deaths, and recoveries?
I also verified the dataset using functions to test the authenticity of the data
